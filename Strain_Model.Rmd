## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(pacman, tidyverse)

# This is a temporary version of the Work() function, which should simulate the agents working and opdate their effort, reward and strain values. 

# 0nly needs to be defined for the first loop
#----
agent_frame <- tibble("agent" = 1:3, "sucess" = 0, "effort" = 1, "reward" = 1, "mental_health" = reward/effort)
project_specs <- 0
model_specs <- 2
sprint_turn <- 1

#----

# if first tun in sprint: 


#SpecScheck()
#----
spec_diff <- abs(project_specs - model_specs)
if(spec_diff >= 4){
  agent_frame$reward <- agent_frame$reward - 4
  model_specs <- model_specs
}

#----

#Work()
#---- 
s_prob <- 0.5*agent_frame[1,5]
colab <- sample(c("sucess", "fail"), 1, prob = c(s_prob,(1-s_prob)))

if(colab == "sucess"){
  agent_frame[1,2] <- agent_frame[1,2] + 1
  agent_frame[1,3] <- agent_frame[1,3] + 1
  agent_frame[1,4] <- agent_frame[1,4] + 1
  agent_frame[1,4] <- agent_frame[1,4]/agent_frame[1,3]
} else {
 agent_frame[1,3] <- agent_frame[1,3] + 1 
 agent_frame[1,4] <- agent_frame[1,4]/agent_frame[1,3]
}

#----

# SpecChange()
#----
spec_chance <- sample(c("none", "positive", "negative"), 1, prob = c(0.8, 0.1, 0.1))
if(spec_change == "positive"){
  project_specs <- project_specs + 1
}
if(spec_change == "negative"){
  project_specs <- project_specs - 1
}

#----

# SprintTurn()
#----
sprint_turn <- sprint_turn + 1
if(sprint_turn == 10){
  if(model_specs > project_specs){
    model_specs <- model_specs - 1
  }
  if(model_specs < project_specs){
    model_specs <- model_specs + 1
  }
  sprint_turn == 0
}
```

## Simulation() function

The Simulation() function gethers all the Work(), Sprint() and Specs() functions to comute the agent based model. 

n_turns = the number of turns simulated 
n_agent = the number of agents

```{r}
Simulation <- function(n_turns, n_agent){
  # two dataframes, one for agent information and one for additional variables, are defined.
  values <- tibble("project_specs" = 0, "agent_specs" = 0, "sprint_turn" = 1)
  agent_frame <- tibble("agent" = 1:n_agent, "sucess" = 0, "effort" = 1, "reward" = 1, "mental_health" = reward/effort)
  
  # For loop for repeating repeating the same procedure for several tuns
  for(i in 1:n_turns){
    # work is siulated and agent_frame is updated
    agent_frame <- Work(0.75, agent_frame)
    # Sprints are simulated and values are udpated 
    values <- Sprint(10, values)
    # Spacs are changed and both agent_frame and values are updated
    both <- Specs(4, agent_frame, values)
    values <- both[[1]]
    agent_frame <- both[[2]]
    print(agent_frame)
  }
  
  return(list(values, agent_frame))
}

# Testing function
twodf <- Simulation(10,3)
twodf[[2]]

```



## Work() function 

The Work() function simulates the agents working on the project. It is used in all conditions. 

colab_prob = the defaoult probablility of a sucessful collaboration (ie. not modefied by mental health yet)

```{r}
# this should work as long as I have an agent_frame defined

Work <- function(colab_prob,agents) {
  
  # For loop repeating for each participant
  for(i in agents$agent){
    
    # Defining the probability of a sucessful collaboration
    s_prob <- colab_prob*agents[i,5]
    
    # Determining if the collaboration is sucessful
    colab <- sample(c("sucess", "fail"), 1, prob = c(s_prob,(1-s_prob)))
    
    # Simulating collaboration
    if(colab == "sucess"){
      agents[i,2] <- agents[i,2] + 1
      agents[i,3] <- agents[i,3] + 1
      agents[i,4] <- agents[i,4] + 1
      agents[i,5] <- agents[i,4]/agents[i,3]
    } else {
    agents[i,3] <- agents[i,3] + 1 
    agents[i,5] <- agents[i,4]/agents[i,3]
    }
  }
  
  # Retuning the modifyed dataframe
  return(agents)
  
}


# Test of function 
agent_frame <- tibble("agent" = 1:3, "sucess" = 0, "effort" = 1, "reward" = 1, "mental_health" = reward/effort)
agent_frame <- Work(0.75)
# It worked


```


## Sprint() Function

Sprint() keeps track of the sprints and changes the model specifications in the Complex condition. It is only used in the Scrum conditions. It should happen at the end of a loop. 

len = the length of the sprint in turns.  

```{r}
# Variables needed to run the function
values <- tibble("project_specs" = 0, "agent_specs" = 0, "sprint_turn" = 1)

Sprint <- function(len, values){
  # Advancing in the sprint
  values$sprint_turn <- values$sprint_turn + 1
  
  # This happens at the last turn of the sprint
  if(values$sprint_turn == len){
    # agent_specs moves closer to project_specs if agent_specs is greater  
    if(values$agent_specs > values$project_specs){
      values$agent_specs <- values$agent_specs - 1
    }
    # agent_specs moves closer to project_specs if agent_specs is smaller
    if(values$agent_specs < values$project_specs){
      values$agent_specs <- values$agent_specs + 1
    }
    # Sprint resets
    values$sprint_turn <- 0
  }
  
  # Function returns changed agent_specs and sprint_turn
  return(values)
}

# Test of function
values <- Sprint(10, values)
# It works


```

## Specs() function

Specs() checks for drift in specifications and imposes a penalty on the simulation if the drift is over a certain threshold. It also chnages the specifications.

threshold = the max distance agent_specs can drift from model_specs

```{r}
# Variables needed to run the function
values <- tibble("project_specs" = 0, "agent_specs" = 0, "sprint_turn" = 1)

Specs <- function(threshold, agent_frame, values){
  # Checking if agent_specs has drifted
  spec_drift <- abs(values$project_specs - values$agent_specs)
  # This happens if agent_specs has drifted
  if(spec_drift >= threshold){
    # Penalty 
    agent_frame$reward <- agent_frame$reward - 4
    # Agent_specs are adapted to model_specs  
    values$agent_specs <- values$project_specs
  }
  
  # Deciding if model_specs should be changed
  spec_change <- sample(c("none", "positive", "negative"), 1, prob = c(0.8, 0.1, 0.1))
  # if spec_chance is positive, 1 is added to model_specs
  if(spec_change == "positive"){
    values$project_specs <- values$project_specs + 1
  }
  # if spec_chance is negative, 1 is subtracted from model_specs
  if(spec_change == "negative"){
    values$project_specs <- values$project_specs - 1
  }
  return(list(values, agent_frame))
}

# Checking if function works
twodf <- Specs(4, values, agent_frame)
twodf[[2]]
# it works


```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
